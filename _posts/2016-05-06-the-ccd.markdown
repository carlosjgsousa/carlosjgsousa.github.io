    The Convention Center Dublin is one of the most outstanding buildings in Dublin city centre. As a conference and exhibition venue the main goals of this project were turning the website responsive, improve the engagement and bring the offline brand guidelines into online.
</p>
<p>
    My main role as lead designer on this project was to provide the client with design solutions for improving the website performance and user experience.
</p>
<p>
    The first phase of many was to redefine the IA and content types the website would have. This information was gathered by workshops with the business owners and industry research.

    After identifying the main areas and content types the website would have the following step was to design wireframes to see how all this information would work together. When developing the wireframes I decided to go modular so I could assemble pages based on areas that later would be replicated rather than unique pages. By doing this I guaranteed visual consistency and also saved some time.

    After the wireframes and workflows done all it was left was to bring the offline brand guidelines into online. We relied on the client to provide guidance along with the brand design agency.

    One of the key pages was the room details page. This page would have to display enough information about the room characteristics so the user could make a decision about booking it or not.

    It was also important to the client to inform The CDD user about the services surrounding the building and this was accomplished by displaying a google maps solution with a filtering system.
