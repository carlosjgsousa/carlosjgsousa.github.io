<p>Working as a designer for more than 10 years I’ve collaborated with many teams across different industries and countries. In these 10 years I’ve wore many hats, from designer, to content producer, to frontend developer, having specialised in <strong>designing experiences</strong>. I want to share with you my design process and what I’ve learnt over these +10 years.</p>
<p>First let me explain what I mean by designing experiences.</p>
<p>As a designer your role, in my opinion, spans across many subjects like analytics, research, strategy, business, SEO, visual design, interaction design, user experience, frontend development, content, marketing and the list goes on. While I’m not an expert in every single one of these areas, I know more than enough to help me <strong>communicate and collaborate with others</strong> to achieve a <strong>goal</strong>, this goal can be a business challenge or a user challenge, and these are always connected.</p>
<p>A business challenge is what’s important for the business, may it be reduce churn, increase conversion rates, better NPS or any other KPI that measures success for that business. It’s important as a designer that you understand these, because without a business, there are no users. Go google it.</p>
<p>A user challenge can be many things too but to understand these one needs a special skill, <strong>empathy</strong>. Empathy is something you learn through experience, it’s looking at analytics, conducting quantitative or/and qualitative research, to fully understand the reasoning behind every action.</p>
<p>And as a designer, your responsibility is to merge these two perspectives, business and user in order to <strong>design experiences</strong> that meet both expectations, constantly, because there is always room for improvement.</p>
<p>I’ve recently adopted the Design Council design approach, Double Diamond, to illustrate what I do as a designer.</p>
<p>Before any project begins, you need a goal, here is an example:</p>
<blockquote>The business needs to increase their online sales&nbsp;channel.</blockquote>
<p>It’s pretty clear, you need to do something in order to increase their online sales number in relation to other channels. Where do you start?</p>
<p>Ask questions, see Sakichi Toyoda’s 5 Whys.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why do we need to increase the online sales channel?<br><strong>A:</strong> Because it’s cheaper from a business point of view.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why is it cheaper?<br><strong>A:</strong> Because users can do this on their own and we don’t need people to sell.</p>
<p>5 Whys later and a few meetings with stakeholders you get a statement that you can work with and something to measure success. Let’s say that after all those chats we have this statement:</p>
<blockquote>The business needs to increase their online sales, so that it can reduce costs and increase&nbsp;profit.</blockquote>
<p>So by increasing online sales, the business makes more money. But what about the user? How is the online experience for the people who use it?</p>
<p>After analysing all this information you will have some ideas that might result on an improvement of your KPI (online sales). What you’ll want to do is conduct some workshops, perhaps a design sprint to come up with some ideas, test them with users, A/B or build measure and learn (Lean).</p>
<p>At the end of all this, you’ll keep checking your success metrics, come up with new ideas on how to improve it even further, because design is never done.</p>
<p>Hopefully it now will take you less than 10 years to approach work using this way.</p>
