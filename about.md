description: Iâ€™m a designer with over 10 years of experience who solves challenges through design thinking.

Hi. Iâ€™m Carlos but many people call me Kiko, a nickname given by my parents when I was just a few months old. I was born in Madeira Island, Portugal, Google it if you donâ€™t know where it is, itâ€™s a beautiful place.

Everything started when I downloaded Photoshop 7.0 around 2003 or so. Back then I was already playing around with HTML and Flash, but the visuals were missing so I gave it a shot. I was hooked. A few years later I went to college and graduated in Communications & Multimedia. I was ready to tackle the world, one pixel at a time.

Throughout the years I worked in many industries and projects as a designer and frontend developer. As time progressed my career shifted to user experience and my background in development and visual design has given me an edge in understanding how things are built and work.

Over Vodafone, I led a team of designers which challenged me a lot not only as a professional but as a person too. It was a very rewarding experience and Iâ€™m grateful to have been given this opportunity.

Today I work as a design consultant over Nagarro. I help clients find a link between the business needs and their customers needs using a human-centred approach, delivering validated value into the market as efficiently as possible.

Personality-wise, Belbin team role says Iâ€™m a Shaper, Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator says Iâ€™m an ISTJ and WizardingWorld tells me Iâ€™m Gryffindor ðŸ˜…. What all this means is, Iâ€™m driven, curious, objective, I like facts and I am decisive. Iâ€™m a team player and someone who is there to give you a hand when you need it.
